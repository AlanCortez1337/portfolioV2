funFact: I personally love baking all kinds of bread and it is what motivated me to see what it would be like to create a bakery website.

## Purpose

Everyone deserves a sweet treat which is why we have yummy bread to fill that void. But what many people forget is that there is a world of delicious savory bread. This is where this bakery Ecommerce proof of concept comes into play to demonstrate what it could be for a home bakery.

## Lore

I created this proof of concept during summer when I got the impulsive urge to start a bakery. While I put that in the back burner... 

This is still something that might happen in the future 👀

## Challenges

I will admit that I struggle with making modern and minimal designs because I love eccentric Neu-Brutalism with clashing colors. Another reason for the challenge is because it was challenging to add depth with just linear-gradients but I was able to address this by adding a textured background. After doing so it made the design feel unique and modern.

## Closer Look at the Mockup

## The Future 

As previously mentioned, this was an idea I had of actually operating and running on the side. However, I got busy and unfortunately could not commit my time to finishing it. But in the near future when I find time I plan on creating this using Stripe and NextJS to making this a working home bakery service.
