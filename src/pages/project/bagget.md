funFact: We came up with the name by accident while brainstorming. We were just throwing random names when we said "baguette" and in that moment everything clicked.

## Purpose

Everyone deserves dignity, especially those striving to provide for their families. Bag/Get is a SaaS aimed to optimize operations for *food banks* and *food pantries* so that they can focus more on *the community*.

## Lore

This originally was a concept the team created for a competition that was sparked by using these services. After winning first place it opened the door to many more opportunities for us to build meaningful software.

## Awards

Including the initial award we went and won the following awards:
- First place in [***Engineering Social Justice Competition 2023***](https://news.fullerton.edu/2023/03/engineering-computing-students-pitch-solutions-to-social-justice-issues/)
- Third place in [***CSU Sunstone Startup Competition 2023***](https://news.fullerton.edu/spotlight/ecs-students-win-third-place-in-csu-sunstone-startup-competition/)
- First place prize category for **Student Research (SCAR) day 2023**
- First place in [***Titan Fast Pitch 2023***](https://news.fullerton.edu/2023/12/student-entrepreneurs-take-first-place-for-food-bank-and-pantry-app/)
- Third place in [***SoCal Celebrates Entrepreneurship Lightning Pitch 2024***](https://www.socalentrepreneurship.org/scce-24)
- First place, ***Pando Days 2023-2024***

## Challenges

The biggest challenge up to this point has to be understanding the food supplementation ecosystem. We've conducted dozens of interviews with food banks and pantries. Overall, through the time researching it has been a fun challenge determining our MVP features to maximize initial impact.

## The Future 

We are currently developing the MVP for Bag/Get and working with [Larta Institute](https://larta.org/venture-fellows-current-cohort/) to run a pilot of our software. Stay tuned for any future updates relating to Bag/Get on our [website](https://bagget.io/) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bagget).
