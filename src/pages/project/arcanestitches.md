## Purpose / Lore

Dive into a whimsical world of crocheted goods and crafts. From headwear, trinkets, and creatures this Ecommerce website has it all. 

This is a revamp mockup design for Arcane Stitches a craft business that predominately sells crocheted items. After researching common Ecommerce UX patterns 

## Challenges

This project was the first time I designed an Ecommerce store, which taught me many lessons. One of the key hurdles was visualizing an appealing layout that balanced aesthetics with functionality. I aimed to create a mystical atmosphere for the sake of the brand while ensuring the user experience remained intuitive and uncluttered. In the end I achieved this with mixing unique wavy SVG shapes and linear gradients.

## The Future 

In the near future I plan using these designs and creating a modern Ecommerce website for Arcane Stitches. Upon further research my tech stack will utilize NextJS for the frontend and the Square SDK to fetch the stock.
