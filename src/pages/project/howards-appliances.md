funFact: The group I am working with all shares a birthday with someone in the group, and we just randomly got put in that group.

## Purpose

ARSE is an AR ecommerce application built for Howard's Applicances. This application is meant to navigate clients across Howard's "experience center" stores to find products and more information about them. The AR aspect is meant to show more information about a specific product the user hover's over. Meanwhile, it would be pretty pointless to create an application for a store without an ecommerce factor which is why we decided to include that.

## Lore

My group was very fortunate to be in a position to develop an application for a legitimate company that had this idea. Currently my group was ironing out the details of the development enviornment and the technologies we need to use in order to finish this product. We concluded that we were going to at the time being develop this application for IOS only due to the positive developer experience and tools provided by Apple. One of those tools that we knew was going to be useful was ARkit which when researching has been used in many similar use case projects.

During this research I allocated some time in order to construct a working prototype of how the application would look and act. I used the popular UI/UX tool Figma for this as a way to seemlessly demonstrate the prototype to the Howard's representative. The final rendition of the application may look way different though considering that the IOS development platform might be a bit restraining in how the UI will look.

As it stands we are going to start development soon so that our Augmented Reality Shopping Experience will see the light of day.

## Challenges

Just like all good computer science projects, time is not on our side unfortunately. We are expected to demonstrate a product around the time of May so it is going to be fun developing this ambitious application. Another challenge that we have been bouncing around with are the technologies and where our focuses should land during the development process. As previously mentioned we are going to be developing for IOS so that renders a lot of options already. Although, with such a large scale project we are looking at additionaly content management systems to help us deliver a product faster.
