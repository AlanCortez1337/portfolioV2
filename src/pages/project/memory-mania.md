## Purpose

Tired of all the existing memory games available? Do you like silly little animals from the internet? Well this memory game allows for silliness and excitement to keep winning.

## Lore

When I first started to learn how to develop in React, I watched a Fireship.io tutorial and he guided me to finishing the skeleton of the web app. However, I took it a step above with unique toast messages, persistent local storage, and more.

## Challenges

This was definitely a fun and challenging introduction when learning React for the first time. It definitely was confusing looking up supplemental tutorials since at the time I was not familiar with the difference between functional and class components. Besides the learning curve, it ignited my interest in front-end web development and led me down a deeper rabbit hole for my future career.
