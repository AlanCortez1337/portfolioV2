## What is ACE Physics?

ACE Physics is an online suite of activities for students to take supplementally to their classes to understand quantum physics. This project was a part of Giaco Corsiglia PhD research that involved physics professors to build alternative learning content.

## The Journey

After being onboarded to this job I collaborated with Giaco Corsiglia who spearheaded this project. It was fun experiencing and getting involved with research that contributed education development. During this time I was exposed to my first production codebase and engaged with more React.js.

## Contributions

During this time I would convert pdf activities into interactive reactive and dynamic forms and even have chances to update the UI to provide a better user experience. Besides that I would offer suggestions to how I believe the activity can flow and act in this web form.
